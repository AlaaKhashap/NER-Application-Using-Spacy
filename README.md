# Streamlit Named Entity Recognition App

This is a simple Streamlit application that uses the spaCy library to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) on text provided by the user.

## Overview

The application takes text input from the user via a text area, processes it using spaCy's `en_core_web_sm` model, and then displays the text with identified entities highlighted.  The visualization is done using spaCy's `displacy` library.

## Features

*   **Text Input:** Allows users to enter text directly into the application.
*   **Named Entity Recognition:** Identifies and classifies named entities in the input text (e.g., persons, organizations, locations).
*   **Visual Highlighting:**  Highlights recognized entities with different colors representing their respective categories.
*   **Streamlit Interface:**  Provides a user-friendly web interface built using Streamlit.

## Technologies Used

*   **Streamlit:** For creating the web application interface.
*   **spaCy:** For Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, specifically Named Entity Recognition.
*   **displacy:** For visualizing the identified entities.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit spacy
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```
    **Important:** This will download and install spaCy and the `en_core_web_sm` model, which is crucial for the application to function correctly.  You can verify that the model is installed by running `python -m spacy info`.

## Running the Application

1.  **Navigate to the project directory (if you're not already there):**

    ```bash
    cd <your-repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Run the Streamlit application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    This will open the application in your web browser.  The app.py file is assumed to be the name of your streamlit script.

## Usage

1.  **Enter text:** Type or paste the text you want to analyze into the text area provided in the application.
2.  **View results:**  The application will automatically process the text and display the text with identified entities highlighted.  Hovering over highlighted entities will usually display the entity type.

## Code Explanation

*   **`import streamlit as st`**: Imports the Streamlit library for creating the web interface.
*   **`import spacy`**: Imports the spaCy library for NLP.
*   **`from spacy import displacy`**: Imports the `displacy` module for visualizing the NER results.
*   **`st.title('Named Entity Recognition')`**: Sets the title of the Streamlit application.
*   **`text = st.text_area('Input Text Here...')`**: Creates a text area widget for user input.
*   **`nlp_model = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')`**: Loads the pre-trained spaCy `en_core_web_sm` model.
*   **`if text:`**: Checks if the user has entered text.
*   **`doc = nlp_model(text)`**: Processes the input text using the spaCy model.
*   **`html_page = displacy.render(doc, style='ent')`**: Generates an HTML representation of the NER results using `displacy`.  `style='ent'` specifies that we want to visualize entities.
*   **`st.write(html_page, unsafe_allow_html=True)`**: Displays the HTML representation in the Streamlit application.  `unsafe_allow_html=True` is necessary because `displacy` generates HTML that Streamlit needs to render.

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

*   **"Model not found" error:** If you encounter an error indicating that the `en_core_web_sm` model is not found, make sure you have downloaded and installed it using:

    ```bash
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```
*   **Other spaCy or Streamlit errors:** Refer to the official spaCy and Streamlit documentation for troubleshooting common issues.
*   **Rendering problems:** Sometimes, the HTML generated by displaCy might not render correctly in all browsers or Streamlit versions.  Try updating Streamlit or using a different browser.

## Potential Improvements

*   **Model Selection:** Allow the user to select different spaCy models (e.g., `en_core_web_md`, `en_core_web_lg`) for potentially better accuracy.
*   **Customization:** Provide options to customize the appearance of the entity highlighting (e.g., colors, fonts).
*   **More detailed entity information:** Display more detailed information about each entity, such as its description or related links.
*   **Support for other languages:** Implement support for other languages by loading different spaCy language models.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling to catch potential issues, such as invalid input text.
*   **Deployment:** Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, Streamlit Cloud) for wider accessibility.
